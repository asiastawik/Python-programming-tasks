# Python Programming Tasks

## Overview
This project includes a series of Python programming tasks designed to explore basic programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and list manipulation. The tasks involve operations like printing formatted messages, performing mathematical checks, and handling prime number generation. Each task builds upon core programming skills, showcasing how to work with data types, perform calculations, and validate user inputs.

## Task 1: Store and Display Student Information

### Description
This task is focused on storing and displaying basic personal information. The program is required to:
- **Store the student's name** in a variable.
- **Store the student's ID number** in a variable, ensuring it is treated as a number.
- **Print a formatted message** that includes the student's name and ID, using string interpolation.
- **Check divisibility** of the student ID by 2 and 3, and display appropriate messages for each condition.
- **Calculate the remainder** of the division of the student ID by the year 2023, and print the result.

### Key Concepts:
- Variables and Data Types
- String Formatting
- Arithmetic Operations (modulus, divisibility)
- Conditional Statements (if-else)

## Task 2: Manipulate and Analyze Digits of Student ID

### Description
In this task, the student's ID is treated as a sequence of individual digits, and the program performs the following operations:
- **Store each digit of the student ID** in a list.
- **Calculate the sum of all digits** in the list.
- **Calculate the product** of the digits located at positions 0, 2, and 3 within the list.
- **Separate the digits into odd and even numbers**, and print two separate strings: one containing the odd digits, and another containing the even digits.

### Key Concepts:
- Lists and Indexing
- Looping through List Elements
- Arithmetic Operations (sum, product)
- Conditional Logic for Number Properties (even/odd)

## Task 3: Birthday Month Check

### Description
This task requires the program to evaluate the month, day, and year of the user's birthday and display information based on specific conditions:
- **Print the birthday month** if it is either January or February.
- **If the month is not January or February**, the program checks the day of birth and prints it if the day is even.
- **If the day is not even**, the program prints the year of birth.

### Key Concepts:
- Conditional Statements with Multiple Conditions
- Date Handling (months, days, years)
- Modulus Operation for Checking Even/Odd

## Task 4: Sum Numbers in a List

### Description
This task involves writing a function that processes a list of elements and returns the sum of all numeric elements within it. The function should ignore any non-numeric objects in the list. The task also involves testing the function with different lists, which contain both numbers and non-number objects (such as strings).

### Key Concepts:
- Functions and Argument Passing
- Type Checking (distinguishing between numbers and non-numbers)
- Handling Mixed Data Types
- Looping through Lists and Applying Conditional Logic

---

## Task 5: First N Prime Numbers

### Description
This task requires the creation of a function that calculates and returns the first **N prime numbers**. Additionally, the program validates the input to ensure that it is a positive integer. If the input is not valid (e.g., if it is a string or a negative number), the program will print an error message and exit.

### Key Concepts:
- Prime Number Calculation (mathematical concept)
- Input Validation (checking if input is a positive integer)
- Error Handling and Messaging
- Loops and Conditional Logic for Number Properties

## Conclusion
The tasks presented in this project offer a comprehensive introduction to Python programming concepts. From basic data storage and formatting to more complex topics like prime number generation and list manipulation, these tasks demonstrate fundamental techniques for solving problems programmatically. This project is ideal for beginners looking to improve their coding skills and understand the logic behind simple mathematical and logical operations.
