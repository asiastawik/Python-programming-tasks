# Python Programming Tasks

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python programs designed to practice basic operations, list manipulations, and functions. The programs involve working with personal data, such as a student ID, performing numeric calculations, and generating prime numbers.

## Task 1: Personal Information and Student ID Operations
This program stores the student's name and ID number, prints them, checks if the student ID is divisible by 2 and 3, and calculates the remainder when the ID is divided by 2023.

## Task 2: Working with Student ID Digits
This program stores the digits of the student ID in a list and performs the following operations:
- Prints the sum of all digits.
- Prints the product of the digits at positions 0, 2, and 3.
- Separates the digits into a string of odd numbers and a string of even numbers.

## Task 3: Birthday Information
This program prints the month of the user's birthday if it falls in January or February. Otherwise, it prints the day of the birthday if it is an even number; if not, it prints the birth year.

## Task 4: Summing Numbers from a List
This program defines a function that takes a list as an argument and returns the sum of all numeric values in the list, ignoring non-numeric objects. The function is tested with various lists.

## Task 5: Prime Numbers Generator
This program defines a function that returns the first N prime numbers, where N is a user-provided argument. If the argument is incorrect (e.g., a string), the program prints a message and exits.
